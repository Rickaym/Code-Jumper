# Code Jumper

Code Jumper is a simple tool to setup markers in source code to restore focus on demand. As with working on different class files for **Java**, header and source files for **C++**, different modules in **Python** navigating through the dense nature of code bases can become overwhelming, tedious and repetitive very quickly. Often times there are cases where various snippets from different file locations are coupled in logic, Code Jumper will help get to pre-determined location in code that has manually been saved.

## Features
